# Life-Beyond
Inspired by Melodysheep's LIFE BEYOND II : "Life Beyond" project is a speculative museum app designed to visualize the vast potential of universal biology. Using immersive data visualization and procedural generation, it explores a wide range of alien life forms, from the familiar to the exotic, across potential extraterrestrial environments.
